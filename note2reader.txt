hey this is Bhanvi Menghani!
and this is my first repo on git hub
so, i am putting my favourite and ofcourse currently 
popular code of a desktop help in pyhon using
 a) speech recognition (speech 2 text) and,
 b) pyttsx3 (text 2 speech) 

The project is just a simpler version of voice assistants
like contora (microsoft), siri (apple) and jarvis(iron man).

requirments:
1. micropone (i used external)
2. headphone
3. USB jack
4. install all the libraries used

some important advice:
1. i used pycharm (an IDE) for various plugins required.
2. both external or internal microphone can work
3. patience is the key!!
